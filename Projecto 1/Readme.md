## Description of the Work
Ideas are a powerful concept. The way in which they are organized in the Web is not the best,
as it is seldom structured. This project aims to organize organize ideas against each other,
and to provide users with an overview on a specific topic as well as an indication of how much
each idea is worth.

In order to promote diversity in the projects, each group should pick a different theme for their
idea manager. Some ideas include politics, sports, hobbies, technology, computer science,
problem solving, mathematics, etc. Users should be able to exchange and discuss ideas, as
well as to trade ideas much like in a stock market.
